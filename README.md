# Introduction

Delve into the Toronto real estate market to understand current trends and potential forecasts through an analysis designed to answer the following questions:

1.  ***Is 2024 a buyer's or seller's market?***

2.  ***How have economic and demographic factors influenced real estate market prices over the past four years?***

 3.  ***What can we forecast for the Toronto real estate market in the next five years?***

Hereâ€™s how I approached these questions:

- ***Supply and Demand Analysis***: I examined the balance between supply and demand to gauge market pressure.

- ***Days on the Market***: I evaluated how long properties stay on the market before being 
sold.

- ***Sales-to-Price Ratio***: I assessed the relationship between listing prices and actual sales prices.

- ***Residential Unit Price Evolution***: I reviewed how the prices of residential units have changed over the past four years.

- ***Demographic and Economic Factors***: I analyzed how demographic shifts and economic conditions influence the real estate market.

- ***Forecast Regression Analysis***: I conducted a regression analysis to predict trends in the real estate market for the next five years.

- ***Conclusions***: Based on my findings, I drew conclusions about the future direction of the market.
