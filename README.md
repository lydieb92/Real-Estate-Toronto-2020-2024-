# Introduction

Delve into the Toronto real estate market to understand current trends and potential forecasts through an analysis designed to answer the following questions:

1.  ***Is 2024 a buyer's or seller's market?***

2.  ***How have economic and demographic factors influenced real estate market prices over the past four years?***

 3.  ***What can we forecast for the Toronto real estate market in the next five years?***

Hereâ€™s how I approached these questions:

- **Supply and Demand Analysis**: I examined the balance between supply and demand to gauge market pressure.

- **Days on the Market**: I evaluated how long properties stay on the market before being 
sold.

- **Sales-to-Price Ratio**: I assessed the relationship between listing prices and actual sales prices.

- **Residential Unit Price Evolution**: I reviewed how the prices of residential units have changed over the past four years.

- **Demographic and Economic Factors**: I analyzed how demographic shifts and economic conditions influence the real estate market.

- **Forecast Regression Analysis**: I conducted a regression analysis to predict trends in the real estate market for the next five years.

- **Conclusions**: Based on my findings, I drew conclusions about the future direction of the market.

# TOOLS I USED

For my deep dive into the Toronto data analysis real estate market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

a. **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

b. **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the box office data.

c. **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

d. **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

e. **Excel**: A versatile tool for creating graphs and forecasting trends.
The Analysis

Each query in this text aims to investigate the Toronto (Canada) real estate market from 2020 to 2024(February). I chose Toronto because I am a Torontonian.

# Is 2024 a buyer's or seller's market?

## Supply and Demand Analysis

I rounded the annual totals of house listings (Total_HL) and houses sold (Total_HS) from the market_data table. After filtering for the specified years, I grouped and ordered the data by year in descending order. This made it easy to see yearly trends in listings and sales.

``` sql
SELECT
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
   ROUND(SUM(House_listing)) AS Total_HL, 
   ROUND(SUM(Houses_Sold)) AS Total_HS 
FROM
   market_data
WHERE
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
   year DESC;
```
## Residential Units Listings and Residential Units Sold (Feb 2020-2024)

(This graph was created using Excel). 

As we can see from this graph, the number of residential unit listings outnumbers the residential units sold. This indicates that 2024 is a buyer's market.



## Days on the Market

I created an SQL query to calculate the average days on market (DOM) for properties listed from 2020 to early 2024. 

``` sql
SELECT
  AVG(CASE WHEN info_date >= '2020-01-01' AND info_date < '2021-01-01' THEN days_on_market END) AS DOM_2020,
  AVG(CASE WHEN info_date >= '2021-01-01' AND info_date < '2022-01-01' THEN days_on_market END) AS DOM_2021,
  AVG(CASE WHEN info_date >= '2022-01-01' AND info_date < '2023-01-01' THEN days_on_market END) AS DOM_2022,
  AVG(CASE WHEN info_date >= '2023-01-01' AND info_date < '2024-01-01' THEN days_on_market END) AS DOM_2023,
  AVG(CASE WHEN info_date >= '2024-01-01' AND info_date < '2024-03-01' THEN days_on_market END) AS DOM_2024
FROM
  all_properties
WHERE
  days_on_market IS NOT NULL;
```
<img src=".vscode/Image 2.png">

(This graph was created using Excel). 

As we can see from this graph, the days on the market for all residential units in Toronto have been increasing since 2021, further indicating that 2024 is a buyer's market.

## Sale-to-List Price Ratio

This query helps assess how properties sell relative to their listing prices.

``` sql
SELECT
 info_date,
 TO_CHAR(avg_price, 'FM$999,999,999.00') AS avg_price,
 TO_CHAR(avg_sold_price, 'FM$999,999,999.00') AS avg_sold_price,
 (avg_sold_price / avg_price * 100) AS STL_Price_Ratio
FROM
 all_properties;
 ```
 <img src=".vscode/Image 3.png">

 (This graph was created using Excel).

The Sale-to-List Price Ratio has been consistently close to 100%, except for a few exceptional months. A Sale-to-List Price Ratio exceeding 100% means that a residential unit sells for more than its listing price, which typically indicates a seller's market.

## Residential Unit Price Evolution

I wrote an SQL query to calculate average property prices annually from 2020 to 2024.

I did the same for different subcategories: 1. Condos, 2. Condo Townhomes, 3. Freehold Townhomes, 4. Detached Homes.

``` sql
SELECT
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
   ROUND(SUM(House_listing)) AS Total_HL, 
   ROUND(SUM(Houses_Sold)) AS Total_HS 
FROM
   market_data
WHERE
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
   year DESC;
```
 <img src=".vscode/All properties.png">
 <img src=".vscode/Condos.png">
 <img src=".vscode/Condo Townhomes.png">
 <img src=".vscode/Freehold.png">
 <img src=".vscode/Detached homes.png"> 
(These graphs were created using Excel)

For all properties, average prices have dropped since 2022. However, the prices for condo townhomes have slightly increased during the same period, indicating that it has been a buyer's market since 2022.

## Prime rates

I created an SQL query to calculate the average prime rate annually from 2020 to 2024.
``` sql
SELECT
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
   ROUND(AVG(prime_rate), 2) AS Average_PrimeRate 
FROM
   economic_indicators
WHERE
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
   year ASC;
```

We can observe a significant increase in prime rates starting from 2022, which explains why the average prices of residential units have dropped since then. This rise in prime rates typically results in higher mortgage rates, decreasing home affordability and reducing demand, thus potentially leading to lower residential unit prices.

## GDP MoM

I created an SQL query to calculate and format the average monthly GDP growth rates annually from 2020 to 2024.
``` sql
SELECT
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
   CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(gdp_mom), 2), '%') AS Average_GDPMoM
FROM
   economic_indicators
WHERE
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
   year ASC;
```
<img src=".vscode/Average MoM.png"> 

As we can see in the table above, GDP has experienced fluctuations since 2020. Despite post-pandemic GDP growth in 2021, 2024 marks another period of growth. This indicates that as people earn more, their ability to afford homes increases, leading to higher demand in the real estate market. It also explains the higher prime rates used to control inflation since 2021, which decreases demand and drives real estate prices down to encourage affordability.

## Unemployment rates 

I wrote a SQL query to analyze and summarize the average unemployment rates for each year from 2020 to 2024. 
``` sql
SELECT
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
   CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(unemployment_rate), 2), '%') AS Average_UnemploymentRate
FROM
   economic_indicators
WHERE
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
   year ASC;
```
 <img src=".vscode/Average Unemployment Rates.png">
 
 From 2020 to 2021, during the pandemic, unemployment soared, leading to lower residential unit prices and reduced prime rates. These conditions influenced central bank policies aimed at boosting GDP growth and job creation, directly impacting mortgage rates. Since 2021, as GDP grew, the unemployment rate decreased, and prime rates increased to control inflation, causing real estate prices to drop.

 ## Average salary (2020-2024)

 This query extracts the year from info_date and calculates the average household income for each year from 2020 to 2024 in the demographics table.
 ``` sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) AS year,
  TO_CHAR(ROUND(AVG(household_income), 2), 'FM$999,999,999.00') AS avg_household_income
FROM
  demographics
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date) IN (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
GROUP BY
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM info_date)
ORDER BY
  year DESC;
```
<img src=".vscode/Average Household Income.png">

The average household income (after-tax) from 2020 to 2024 ranges between $74,000 and $76,000. On Ratehub.ca, if you enter these values along with a down payment of $40,000, the maximum home price you can afford is approximately $330,000.

# What can we forecast for the Toronto real estate market in the next five years?

## Forecast Regression Analysis

With regression analysis, we can make assumptions about what the real estate market will be like if it continues to follow the same patterns.

I exported a CSV file containing tables that show the price evolution for all categories of residential units (condos, condo townhomes, townhomes, and detached homes) in Toronto. Then I created an Excel table where I used the forecast formula below for the years 2024-2029.

**=FORECAST.ETS(target_date, values, timeline, [seasonality], [data_completion], [aggregation])**
